# AGENTS.md

Meta-guideline for AI coding agents and contributors working in this repository. Read this first,
then let `openspec/specs/` and active change specs be the source of durable architecture truth.

## Suunta In One Sentence

Suunta is a thin, sans-I/O convergence-planning core: given a desired `Bearing`
and the domain's certified satisfaction of each target (the `Fix`), it computes the
residual `Course` (the `Correction`s that remain) by filtering the `Bearing` to what
the domain has not certified done, while making no semantic judgment of its own.

This repository is intentionally narrow. Suunta is not a workflow engine, a
scheduler, or a durable-execution runtime. Durability, gating, and compensation are
downstream consumer concerns, not the identity of the core.

## Architectural Axioms

Before proposing or writing code, protect these axioms:

1. **Planning core stays thin**: `suunta-contract` owns the residual computation
   and the `Course`/`Correction` vocabulary. It does not own execution, durability,
   scheduling, gating, or compensation.
2. **No semantic judgment in the core**: semantic identity (`Sigil`), target
   satisfaction (the `Fix` — whether reality meets a `Bearing` target), relevance (a
   coverage verdict), and settlement predicates are domain-supplied. The core
   computes the residual and records; it never compares meanings. This is the
   *semantic bill of purity* (four faces) — its cost (silent failure on domain
   semantic error) is accepted deliberately, not patched by pulling judgment into the
   core.
3. **Sans-I/O purity**: the core exposes no `async fn`, reads no ambient clock, and
   performs no I/O. A runtime drives it and injects time at the edge.
4. **Vocabulary is governance**: names such as `Sounding`, `Fix`, `Bearing`,
   `Course`, `Correction`, `Sigil`, and `Drift` protect the navigation worldview.

   siblings: ▢ ▢ ▢   intentionally blank — this repo is sibling-blind. Which
                     products compose together is a consumer app's knowledge, never
                     a component's; naming a sibling here would leak that knowledge
                     and rot when the roster changes.

```

Suunta shares a **discipline** with its lineage, not code: its own crates, specs, constitution, and
release cadence. It does not import, track, or depend on any sibling product, and its governed
prose (`PROJECT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, specs, and code comments) names none.

## Document Authority

- `openspec/specs/` is shipped architecture truth.
- `openspec/changes/` contains active proposed truth until it is synced.
- `PROJECT.md` states product vision, positioning, and non-goals.
- `docs/domain-language.md` is the canonical vocabulary.
- `BACKLOG.md` records settled and deferred decisions, open design questions, and candidate
  patterns, not mandatory phases.
- `AGENTS.md` is operating protocol for agents and contributors.
- `AGENTS.suunta-law.md` is the generated, freshness-gated projection of the accepted Rust
  constitution in `crates/suunta-governance`. The constitution is authoritative; read the
  projection after this file, regenerate it with its documented command, and never edit it by
  hand.
- Other files under `docs/` elaborate one topic each and yield to the documents above.

Decision provenance lives in git — the commit body and pull request that made a change record its
rationale. Forward-looking or reversed decisions are noted in `BACKLOG.md`. There is no separate
architecture-decision-record file class; the living documents above are the single source of
truth for current state, and git is the source of truth for why it changed.

If these documents conflict, fix the conflict through an OpenSpec change before implementing
feature code.

## Adversarial Review Stance

Every change passes an adversarial review at BOTH the propose and apply phases before it is
committed. Actively challenge the design:

- **Propose phase**: Does the change make the planning core heavier than the
  residual mechanism requires? Does it smuggle a semantic judgment (identity,
  relevance, settlement) into the core instead of the domain? Does it treat a
  downstream concern (durability, gating, execution, compensation) as core identity?
- **Apply phase**: Does the implementation leak I/O, async, an ambient clock, or a
  semantic comparison into the core? Does Tianheng still bite the boundary that the
  prose claims?

Reject or redesign changes that pull Suunta toward an orchestration monolith.

## Disposition Discipline

An open design question is dispositioned from Suunta's identity as a design pattern,
never by deferring to a consumer that does not yet exist. Adjudicate each open item into
exactly one of:

- a **noun** — part of Suunta's owned surface (the navigation vocabulary or the residual
  mechanism), articulated now from the pattern's own needs; or
- a **verb** — judgment, execution, or driving that belongs to the consumer, declared
  downstream and permanently not Suunta's.

"Wait for the first real consumer to force the shape" is not a valid disposition: it
hands Suunta's design authority to a coupling partner and drifts the pattern toward the
consumer-driven monolith it is defined against. Declaring an item a permanent consumer
verb commits Suunta to *less*, not more, than freezing a shape once a consumer appears,
so this discipline strengthens least-commitment rather than weakening it. Review rejects
any proposal that reintroduces consumer-driven deferral. Like the no-semantic-judgment
axiom, this is a judgment-level, review-governed rule — not a Tianheng tooth.

A third disposition sits alongside noun and verb: **manifestation** — making an
*already-decided-true* property of Suunta explicit or machine-guarded (for example,
enforcing that the facade re-exports exactly its intended surface). Manifestation adds no
obligation the consumer must satisfy and changes no contract, so it needs no consumer to
justify it and does not over-commit. The rider: manifestation is only free for what is
*already* decided true — manifesting an open question would smuggle a decision, which is
over-commitment in disguise.

## Governance and Conformance

Suunta separates the *judgment* from the *check on its projection*.

- **Governance is judgment, and lives in prose** — `openspec/specs/`, this file, `PROJECT.md`,
  and `BACKLOG.md`. Intent and meaning are decided here and stay review-governed.
- **Code is the projection of a judgment onto the structural plane** — a `pub use` set, an absent
  `async fn`, a dependency edge, a missing trait bound.
- **Conformance verifies the projection still matches the judgment.** It is a family: Tianheng
  (structure, dependencies, source scans), `rustc` (type facts), and tests (behavior). They bite
  the projection, never the judgment itself.

Tianheng's accepted constitution projects into `AGENTS.suunta-law.md`; a freshness test byte-checks
that generated context against the live declaration, so accepted law is visible without a second
hand-maintained authority. A green gate means "no visible violation", not proof: a judgment that
casts no structural shadow stays prose, and a source scan cannot see what a macro expands to.

Before turning a judgment into a Tianheng tooth, it must pass four gates — casting a shadow is
necessary, not sufficient:

1. **Shadow** — does the judgment project into a syntactically decidable structural fact? (No →
   it stays prose and review.)
2. **Faithful** — is that fact a faithful proxy, not a gameable one? (Lines of code are not
   thinness; a proxy invites Goodhart.)
3. **Stable** — is the judgment stable? A tooth on a moving projection is a recurring maintenance
   tax and a second copy of the truth; prefer a test.
4. **Sync** — is the extra `prose ⟷ tooth` coupling worth it? The tooth is itself a *second
   projection* of the judgment, and nothing mechanically checks it matches the prose — only
   review does. The regress terminates in a human.

Fail any gate and the honest home is prose, review, or a test — never a faked tooth. A tooth
complements review; it never replaces it. Where an accepted boundary does hold a claim, its
reason is the single statement of that rule, and prose that merely restated it may be retired.

Repair code toward a violated reason; never weaken a law, baseline new drift, or change severity
merely to make a check green. A deliberate law change requires explicit authority, focused
violating and clean reaction proofs, projection regeneration, and adversarial review.

## OpenSpec Workflow

`openspec/` is the version-controlled, agent-neutral source of truth: `openspec/specs/` is the
living specification of what the system is, and `openspec/changes/` holds active change proposals
as delta specs. Per-agent command files (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, editor shims) are generated per
clone and never committed; generate your own with `openspec init --tools <tool>`.

The lifecycle is:

```text
explore -> propose -> apply -> sync
```

1. **Explore**: investigate and shape intent. Read the relevant `openspec/specs/` first. Do not
   write feature code outside a change.
2. **Propose**: `openspec new change "<change>"`, then write `proposal.md`, `design.md`,
   `tasks.md`, and delta specs with success, failure, and edge scenarios. Commit as
   `docs(<change>): propose <summary>`.
3. **Apply**: implement against the active delta specs, one task at a time, and check a task off
   only after the Definition of Done passes. Keep changes minimal and scoped; never bundle
   unrelated work. Commit coherent compiling milestones as `feat(...)` or `fix(...)`.
4. **Sync**: merge verified delta specs into `openspec/specs/` (agent-driven — the CLI has no sync
   command), then `git rm -r openspec/changes/<change>/`. There is no archive: the change's
   content now lives in `openspec/specs/` and git history. Never run `openspec archive`. Commit
   as `docs(specs): sync <change>`.

Requirement changes reach `openspec/specs/` through sync, never through silent code edits.
Without agent slash commands, use the CLI:

```bash
openspec list [--json] [--specs]
openspec new change "<change>"
openspec status --change "<change>" --json
openspec instructions <artifact> --change "<change>"
```

## Language

- Write OpenSpec artifacts, `BACKLOG.md` entries, code comments, and commit messages in English.
- Converse with users in the language they use.
- Wrap Markdown prose near 100 columns; tables and code blocks are exempt.

## Commit And Integration Governance

### Branch Commits

- Use Conventional Commits: `type(scope): summary`.
- Write the subject in English, lowercase imperative mood, at no more than 72 characters.
- Use the body to record motivation, important decisions, constraints, and verification when that
  context exists. Do not merely enumerate changed files.
- Do not append pull request or issue numbers to the subject or body.
- Development branches may contain multiple coherent commits because the pull request is
  squash-merged.

### Pull Requests

- Branch from `main` and open every change directly against `main`.
- Make the pull request title the intended squash commit subject.
- Give every pull request a non-empty body that explains why the change is needed, what changed,
  consequential decisions or tradeoffs, and verification.
- Rebase the branch onto the current `main` before final verification.
- Do not introduce a release integration branch between a change and `main`.

### Squash Merges

- Squash-merge every verified pull request into `main`.
- Make the squash commit subject exactly the approved pull request title. Hosting tools append
  the pull request number by default; remove it.
- Give every squash commit a non-empty, self-describing body distilled from the approved pull
  request body: preserve durable rationale, decisions, constraints, and verification; omit
  transient checklists and generated commit lists.
- Do not append a pull request number, issue number, or URL to the squash subject or body.
- Every content-changing commit on `main`, including release preparation, must come from a
  squash-merged pull request.
- Keep `main` releasable after every merge.

### Attribution

- Do not include AI, agent, model, tool, automation, or generation attribution in commits, pull
  requests, tags, changelogs, or release notes.
- Prohibited forms include AI `Co-authored-by` trailers, `generated by`, `written with`, model or
  agent names used as signatures, and tool signatures.
- A `Co-authored-by` trailer is allowed only for a real human contributor.

### Changelog

- `CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
  [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), and is a strict release ledger: it
  has no `[Unreleased]` section. Unreleased work is recorded in OpenSpec changes, pull requests,
  and `BACKLOG.md`.
- Write each version's entry in its own release-preparation pull request, cross-checked against
  the commit history since the previous release.
- Every `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading has a matching `[X.Y.Z]: <url>` footer link to
  `.../releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`. `scripts/changelog-guard.sh` checks this and runs in the Definition
  of Done.

### Release Finalization

- Prepare release content in a pull request whose squash subject is exactly
  `chore(release): prepare X.Y.Z`.
- Sweep crate-level README files and other non-governed prose for stale version markers or
  disposition language that `BACKLOG.md` has since resolved, superseded, or placed downstream.
- Give the release preparation squash commit a non-empty body describing scope, compatibility,
  metadata changes, and verification.
- Run the complete Definition of Done after that commit reaches `main`.
- Publish crates in dependency order, waiting for each to appear in the crates.io index before
  publishing its dependents. If an upload's result is uncertain, query crates.io for the exact
  version before retrying — a published version cannot be overwritten.
- Finalize with annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` on that commit, with message exactly `release: X.Y.Z`.
- Push the tag without another commit. Release branches and empty release commits are not part
  of the flow.

## Definition Of Done

Run these from the workspace root before checking off implementation tasks or syncing specs. This
is the single source for the gate list — `README.md` and `docs/development-flow.md` point here
rather than restating it. If a command cannot run in the current environment, report that
explicitly.

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps
cargo deny check
cargo run -p suunta-governance -- check --manifest-path Cargo.toml
./scripts/changelog-guard.sh
npx -y @fission-ai/openspec@1.13.2 validate --all --strict --no-interactive
cargo +1.88 build --workspace
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same gates on push and pull request. Rust style lives in
these checks: rustfmt formats, clippy denies warnings, rustdoc denies documentation warnings,
cargo-deny owns resolved supply-chain policy, `suunta-governance` owns Tianheng architecture
boundaries, and the pinned OpenSpec CLI validates the specs and any active change.
