# suunta-contract

The isolated core contract for Suunta: sans-I/O convergence planning.

`suunta-contract` computes the residual `Course` — the `Correction`s that remain of a
desired `Bearing` once the domain's verdicts have certified targets done — and makes no
semantic judgment of its own:
identity (`Sigil`), target satisfaction, relevance, and settlement are all
domain-supplied. It exposes no `async fn`, reads no ambient clock, and performs no
I/O; a runtime drives it.

0.1.0 ships the residual planner (`plan_residual`, `Bearing`, satisfaction/coverage
findings) alongside the `Correction`/`Course`/`Sigil`/`Reversibility` vocabulary. The
settlement predicate, the production-side coverage contract, and an async edge remain
deferred.
